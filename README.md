# MNIST exploration and prediction

## Context
This project consists of two Jupyter notebooks that explore and analyze the MNIST and Fashion MNIST datasets. It was my first experience working with these popular machine learning datasets.

## Project structure
```bash
project/

├── .gitignore
├── mnist_fashion.ipynb             # Notebook for model training on fashion version of MNIST dataset
├── mnist.ipynb                     # Main notebook, with model trained on MNIST dataset
├── README.md
└── requirements.txt                # Dependencies to install
```

## Notebooks Overview

### MNIST Exploration
In this notebook, I:
- Loaded and preprocessed the MNIST dataset
- Visualized sample images and explored data distribution
- Implemented and trained a machine learning model for digit recognition
- Evaluated the model's performance and made predictions on test data

### Fashion MNIST Exploration
This notebook follows a similar structure to the MNIST exploration, but focuses on the Fashion MNIST dataset. It includes:
- Data loading and preprocessing of Fashion MNIST
- Visualization of clothing item samples
- Model implementation and training for clothing classification
- Performance evaluation and predictions on fashion items

## Key Learnings
Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with:
- Working with image datasets in machine learning
- Data preprocessing and visualization techniques
- Implementing and training models for image classification
- Evaluating model performance and making predictions
